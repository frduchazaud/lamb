# lamb
A new functional language to test concepts


## Why
In my relentless research for a perfect world, I need a perfect functional language.
I am very inspired by:
- Haskell: no comment
- Elm: for its simplicity, its clarity, its easiness, its UI architecture (TEA)
- Idris: many improvement over Haskell. A bit to complex yet.
- herculus.io: a project for reactive functional spreadsheet with good syntax. Never see it working but interesting videos and help files

## LAMB
This name comes from:
- Lambda (calculus): of course!
- A young sheep: This language ambition is just to follow pre-existing ones to create a new synthesis. It is still very young and immature

## Features
- purely functional
- strict evaluation, unless specified
- incremental 
- efficent parser /Ã  la/ Elm
- Elm records
- With embeded UI: every project should begin with a visual interface
